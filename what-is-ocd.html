            <h1>What is OCD?</h1>
            <p>
                Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common, chronic, and long-lasting disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts ("obsessions") and/or behaviors ("compulsions"). They may need to do these compulsions once or repeatedly until they feel more at ease. Obsessions and compulsions can vary from person to person, but there are several broad categories. People often experience symptoms from several different categories, which can evolve over time.

            <h5>5 Common Types of OCD</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Organization: </strong>
                    Obsession with how things are placed and its symmetry
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contamination: </strong>
                    The paranoid thought that people can spread non-viral illnesses through close proximity
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Intrusive Thoughts: </strong>
                    Distressing and often abhorrent ideas pop into their heads randomly
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ruminations: </strong>
                    Similar to intrusive thought-based OCD, but the thoughts may be philosophical, religious or metaphysical conundrums (questions with no answers)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Checking: </strong>
                    Overly concerned about causing damage or harm by being careless
                </li>
            </ol>
